The Dragonborn is a DND / BG inspired character that aims to become the new firelord. He will try to burn down your castle at any given moment while bolstering his defenses with thick walls and fire. Fire everywhere. When it comes to ai strengh he goes right in S+ tier imo. VS players, his defenses are easy to exploit and his army overall weak but make no mistake, for he will come for your gold, if you let him built.
