## Description

The Dragonborn is a DND / BG inspired character who aims to become the new Firelord. He will try to burn down your castle at any given moment, while bolstering his defences with thick walls and fire. When it comes to ai strengh, he goes right in S+ tier imo. VS players, his defences are easy to exploit and his army is overall weak but make no mistake, for he will come for your gold, if you let him build up his forces.

## Background

His real name has been lost to the past as he finds himself in the ruins of a burnt down village. Following the only person who never attacked him on sight, the Alchemist leads the Dragonborn through battle after battle, strengthening him with his powerful potions - or maybe more poisons? On what could only be described as a selfish suicide mission. With every sip, his fire grew hotter, and with every bottle downed his mind foggier until there is nothing but a mindless killing machine left, ending everything in his path with the Alchemist always smiling at his side.

## Castle layout

The head of a dragon shaped into a castle layout. The main industry secured by a thick skull and massive horn like walls surrounded by fire and wild dogs.

The layout of the industry is an somewhat optimal pathway to boost economy. Further boosting the economy is the overall negative fear factor. 

The main church stands proud front and center secure by a small wall. (In layout 1)

## Gameplay

The Dragonborn will spend the early game building up his economy and sending out slaves after slaves after slaves to slow down progress of the enemy. 

The attack phase will start after quit some time but with a sizeable army. The strong economy will make sure that attacks once started will return frequent.

## Strengh vs vanilla AI

Will beat any vanilla ai eventually. Strong defenders will take a long time.

- Defensive 9/10
- Harras 8/10
- Offense 8/10

## Strengh vs player

This is very subjective. Just my gut feeling. The more you cheese the easier he will be ofc.

- Defensive 4/10
- Harras 5/10
- Offense 4/10
