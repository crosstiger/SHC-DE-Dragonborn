## Description

The Dragonborn is a DND / BG inspired character that aims to become the new firelord. He will try to burn down your castle at any given moment while bolstering his defenses with thick walls and fire. Fire everywhere. When it comes to ai strengh he goes right in S+ tier imo. VS players, his defenses are easy to exploit and his army overall weak but make no mistake, for he will come for your gold, if you let him built. 

## Background

Idk yet. Got some ideas.

## Castle layout

The head of a dragonborn shaped into a castle layout. The main industry secured by a thick skull and massive horn like walls surrounded by fire and wild dogs.

The industry is layed out in a somewhat optimal pathway to boost econnomy. Futher boosting the econnomy is the overall negative fear factor. 

The main church stands proud front and center secure by a small wall. 

## Gameplay

The dragonborn will spend the early game building up his econnomy and sending out slaves after slaves after slaves to slow down progress of the enemy. 

The attack phase will start after quit some time but with a sizeable army. The strong econnomy will make sure that attacks once started will return frequent.

## Strengh vs vanilla AI

Will beat any vanilla ai eventually. Strong defenders will take a long time.

- Defensive 9/10
- Harras 8/10
- Offense 8/10

## Strengh vs player

This is very subjective. Just my gut feeling. The more you cheese the easier he will be ofc.

- Defensive 6/10
- Harras 5/10
- Offense 4/10
